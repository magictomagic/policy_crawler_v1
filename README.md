# Policy Crawler

## Background
Many marketing professionals, salespeople, and company executives require access to the latest policy updates to align their market strategies accordingly. Numerous companies designate specific personnel or departments to crawl and organize information from the web, which is then provided to their staff or sold online. This project focuses on crawling the latest publicly released information from major government websites in East and South Mainland China. Initially, the information is disseminated freely via RSS feeds, with considerations for other distribution models in later stages.

## Architecture
DDD


### Packet dependent constraint
> Like maven, constraint specific packages only use in specific layer, and layers can only invoke each other in a specific direction.
